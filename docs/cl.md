LaunchNW Post-Secondary Program Coordinator Search Committee  

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am excited to apply for the Post-Secondary Program Coordinator position at Cheney High School. My background in education, youth mentorship, technology, and community engagement aligns strongly with your mission to support high school students' success.

As founder of Qompass AI, I trained 12 interns through an AI-driven medical education pilot funded by a major grant. In previous roles, I coordinated mentorships for medical students, founded outreach initiatives that reached over 8,000 youth, and built educational partnerships with medical organizations. These efforts reflect my ability to mobilize resources, deliver evidence-based programs, and foster academic growth.

With a B.S. in Life Sciences (Nuclear Engineering Track) from West Point and significant Army leadership experience, I excel at motivating teams and collaborating with community and school stakeholders. My skills include curriculum development, data reporting, and technology integration.

I am passionate about helping students prepare for life after high school and would bring a results-oriented, compassionate approach to CISNEW and LaunchNW. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to support your important work.

Sincerely,  
Matthew Anthony Porter
