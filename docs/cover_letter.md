**Communities In Schools of Northeast Washington**  
LaunchNW Post-Secondary Program Coordinator Search Committee

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am excited to apply for the Post-Secondary Program Coordinator position at Cheney High School with Communities In Schools of Northeast Washington and LaunchNW. My diverse background in education, youth mentorship, technology, and community engagement aligns strongly with your mission to support high school students’ post-secondary success.

My career spans hands-on youth development, advanced academic programming, and impact-driven leadership. Most recently, as the founder of Qompass AI, I led a grant-supported intern program that trained high school and college students in technology, guiding 12 interns through a generative AI medical education pilot. My experience mentoring and designing enrichment content is further evidenced by my service as an Education Ambassador with organizations such as the North American Spine Society, MedAll, and Elsevier, where I coordinated mentorships between 22 underrepresented medical students and 13 longitudinal mentors at 14 U.S. medical schools.

My work as Student Educational Leader at Washington State University College of Medicine included founding an AI-enabled Youth Outreach initiative that reached over 8,000 youth statewide, multiple student group launches, and successful partnership-building with residency programs and hospital systems. Through these efforts, I developed and implemented evidence-based strategies to address educational barriers for at-risk youth, including leading academic support activities, family engagement events, and career readiness programs.

With a Bachelor of Science in Life Sciences (Nuclear Engineering Track) from West Point—complemented by my Army leadership experience and honors—I am adept at motivating diverse teams, project management, and effective communication with students, staff, community partners, and families. As a published researcher and certified educator, I bring strong skills in curriculum development, data tracking and reporting, and technology integration.

I am passionate about supporting students as they pursue training, education, and career exploration after high school. My background managing youth programs, mentoring, and collaborating with multiple layers of supervision prepares me well for the multifaceted, collaborative nature of this position. I will bring a tactful, mature, and flexible approach, rooted in real-world experience working with vulnerable populations.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to CISNEW and LaunchNW’s impactful work at Cheney High School. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience can support your goals.

Sincerely,  
Matthew Anthony Porter
